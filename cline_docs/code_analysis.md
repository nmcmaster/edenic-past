# Code Analysis and Refactoring Guidelines

## Current Code Status

### File Size Analysis
All files in the project currently maintain a healthy size under 300 lines. Key files and their approximate sizes:

1. Layout Files
   - src/app/layout.tsx (~50 lines)
   - src/app/red-amarcord/layout.tsx (~100 lines)
   - src/app/promo/layout.tsx (~40 lines)

2. Component Files
   - src/app/ui/MediaPlayer.tsx (~60 lines)
   - src/app/ui/Nav.tsx (~50 lines)
   - Other UI components: < 30 lines each

3. Page Files
   - Most page files: 30-50 lines
   - Content-heavy pages: ~100 lines

## Code Quality Metrics

### Component Structure
- Components follow single responsibility principle
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent prop typing
- Minimal state management

### File Organization
- Logical directory structure
- Related components grouped together
- Clear naming conventions
- Consistent file structure

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Consider Refactoring
1. If a file approaches 250 lines:
   - Review for potential component extraction
   - Consider splitting into smaller, focused components
   - Look for repeated patterns that could be abstracted

2. If similar code appears in multiple files:
   - Create shared components
   - Extract common utilities
   - Implement shared hooks if needed

3. If component complexity increases:
   - Break down into smaller components
   - Extract business logic into custom hooks
   - Separate presentation from logic

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Components are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] Props are properly typed
- [ ] State management is minimal and necessary
- [ ] File structure is logical and maintainable
- [ ] Code is well-documented where needed
- [ ] Consistent styling approach is used
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Code Reviews
1. Check file sizes regularly
2. Review component complexity
3. Look for opportunities to improve code organization
4. Ensure consistent patterns are followed

### Performance Considerations
- Monitor client-side code size
- Review component re-renders
- Check bundle size impacts
- Evaluate code splitting needs

## Best Practices

### File Structure
```
src/app/
├── ui/                 # Keep UI components small and focused
├── [feature]/         # Group related feature code
└── utils/             # Extract shared utilities
```

### Component Guidelines
1. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
2. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
3. Maintain consistent prop interfaces
4. Document complex logic or business rules

### Code Organization
1. Group related code together
2. Use clear, descriptive naming
3. Maintain consistent file structure
4. Document architectural decisions

## Future Considerations
- Implement automated code quality checks
- Set up bundle size monitoring
- Consider implementing component documentation
- Add performance monitoring tools
